    <h2>This morning I woke up to dozens of messages from students who had read an article titled “Please Don’t Learn to Code.”</h2>
    <p>At first, I assumed <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/please-dont-learn-to-code/" target="_blank">Jeff Atwood’s 2012 article</a> had spontaneously reappeared on Reddit. <br>But no — this was a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/10/please-dont-learn-to-code/">brand new Tech Crunch article</a> of the same name, which echoed Atwood’s assertion that encouraging everyone to learn programming is like encouraging everyone to learn plumbing.</p>
    <p>Here’s why programming — unlike plumbing — is an important skill that everyone should learn: <strong>programming is how humans talk to machines.</strong></p>

     <p class="bord">“Everyone needs computer programming. It will be the way we speak to the servants.” — John McCarthy</p>
    <p><strong>People have been managing other people for thousands of years.</strong></p>
    <p>The ancient Romans built their empire on the backs of slave labor. The British built their empire by imposing their will on the residents of dozens of colonies. And America became the economic force it is today largely thanks to cheap immigrant labor during the industrial revolution.</p>
    <p>But here in the 21st century, we no longer get work done by managing people who tend grain fields, import spices from Asian colonies, or install railroads across the Rocky Mountains. <br> Now we get work done by managing machines.</p>
    <p><strong>Coding isn’t some niche skill. It really is “the new literacy.”</strong></p>
    <p>It’s the essential 21st century skill that every ambitious person needs to learn if they want to succeed.
      <br> Don’t believe me? Just look at the legal profession. Software is turning it inside out, and causing mass unemployment for the lawyers who can’t code. 
      <br> The same is increasingly true for managers, marketers, accountants, doctors, and pretty much every white-collar job in between.</p>
